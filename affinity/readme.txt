== Description ==

Affinity is a classic one-page theme designed with weddings and family announcements in mind. 


== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New affinity.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.


== Setting Up Your Front Page ==

When you first activate Affinity, your homepage displays posts in a traditional blog format. To set up your homepage, follow these steps:

1) Create a page.
2) Go to the Customizer’s Static Front Page panel and set “Front page displays” to “A static page.”
3) Select the page created in Step One as “Front page,” and choose another page as “Posts page” to display your blog posts.

Good news! This theme doesn’t need a front-page template — set a static page as your front page, and you’re good to go. On its own, the page displays a single panel with a full-screen featured image, your site logo, description, and navigation, and your page content.

To get your site set up, you’ll want to add some more panels.

== Adding Panels == 

Each “panel” is a standard page. To add additional panels to your Front Page, follow these steps:

1) Create or edit a page.
2) Navigate to Customize → Theme Options. From the drop-down, select the page you’d like to appear in the panel.

== Panel setup in the Customizer ==

To set the background image of your panel, assign a Featured Image to the page.

Click on the diamond-shaped links to navigate through the front-page panels, or adjust the opacity of the Featured Images from Customize → Theme Options → General.


== Featured Images ==

Affinity supports prominent Featured Images on the blog, and single posts and pages.


== Theme Options ==

In addition to the Front Page, you can customize the theme’s behavior under Customize → Theme Options → General.

-- Header Image Opacity --

Change the opacity of the header image for better contrast with the text.

-- Scrolling Featured Images --

Uncheck “Allow Featured Images to scroll in the background on large screens” to change the scrolling behavior of the header and front page Featured Images on large screens.

Note: The scrolling behavior is not visible in the Customizer for performance reasons, but you’ll see it on the front page of your site.


== Widgets ==

Affinity boasts a one-column or two-column layout. Add widgets to the Sidebar area for a traditional two-column blog, or leave it blank for a sleek one-column style. The theme also includes three optional widget areas in the footer

Configure these widget areas from Customize → Widgets.


== Page Templates ==

Affinity comes with two Page Templates for dressing up your content:

-- Full-Width Template --

The Full-Width template gives you more space for your content. It’s the perfect way to showcase a large gallery of images or a video.

-- Guestbook Template --

Designed with weddings in mind, the Guestbook template highlights your visitors’ comments.

When using this template on a page, it’s good to double-check that comments are enabled. To do this, edit the page and click on More Options. Under the Discussion header, check Allow Comments and publish.


== Social Links ==

Affinity supports a Jetpack Social Links (jetpack.me/) menu, which appears in the footer. Linking to any of the following sites will automatically display its icon in your menu:

CodePen					Digg
Dribbble				Dropbox
Facebook				Flickr
github 					Google+
Instagram				LinkedIn
Email (mailto: links)	Pinterest
Pocket					Polldaddy
Reddit					RSS Feed (urls with /feed/)
StumbleUpon				Tumblr
Twitter					Vimeo
WordPress				YouTube


== Post Intro ==

Affinity has a small but nifty intro feature. Also known as a “deck” or “kicker,” the intro area is displayed between the headline and body copy on posts.

Your intro provides important information and acts as a link between the title and the rest of your post. A carefully crafted deck grabs readers’ attention, giving them an idea of what to expect in the full post.

Add your intro in the Excerpt field of each post, which you’ll find in the More Options area of the Post Editor sidebar.
