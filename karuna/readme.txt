== Description ==

Karuna is a clean business theme designed with health and wellness-focused sites in mind. With bright, bold colors, prominent featured images, and support for customer testimonials, your business' brand will shine with Karuna.


== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New affinity.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.


== Setting Up Your Front Page ==

When you first activate Karuna, your homepage displays posts in a traditional blog format. To set up your homepage, follow these steps:

1) Create a page.
2) Go to the Customizer’s Static Front Page panel and set “Front page displays” to “A static page.”
3) Select the page created in Step One as “Front page,” and choose another page as “Posts page” to display your blog posts.

Karuna's front page displays, in order:

* The site header;
* the page title and content, if set;
* two recent user Testimonials (requires Jetpack: http://jetpack.com);
* the four most recent Posts;
* and the site footer.


== Featured Images / Custom Header ==

Karuna supports prominent Featured Images on the blog, single posts, and pages.

* On blog posts -- 624 pixels wide maximum by unlimited height.
* On single posts and pages -- full-screen width, unlimited height.

On single posts and pages, if no Featured Image is set, the Custom Header will be displayed instead.


== Custom Menus ==

-- Main Menu --

This theme has one main menu area called "Header." If you don't assign a custom menu to that area, your site's default page menu is displayed instead.

-- Social Links --

Karuna supports a Jetpack Social Links (jetpack.com) menu, which appears in the footer. Linking to any of the following sites will automatically display its icon in your menu:

CodePen					Digg
Dribbble				Dropbox
Facebook				Flickr
github 					Google+
Instagram				LinkedIn
Email (mailto: links)	Pinterest
Pocket					Polldaddy
Reddit					RSS Feed (urls with /feed/)
StumbleUpon				Tumblr
Twitter					Vimeo
WordPress				YouTube


== Widgets ==

-- Sidebar --

Karuna has a one-column or two-column layout. Add widgets to the sidebar area for a traditional two-column blog, or leave it blank for a sleek one-column style.

-- Full-Width Header --

This area, displayed under the site header, is a great place for a callout using a Text widget.

-- Full-Width Footer --

This area, displayed after your content and before the four optional footer widget areas, is a great space for a large video or photo gallery widget.

-- Footer Widget Areas --

Karuna also includes up to four optional widget areas in the footer.

Configure these widget areas from Customize → Widgets.


== Testimonials ==

Download Jetpack http://jetpack.com/ to activate this feature. Karuna features testimonials in two ways:

* The dedicated testimonial archive page displays all testimonials in reverse chronological order, with the newest displayed first.
* The Testimonial Shortcode allows you to display the testimonials wherever you want on your site.

To add a testimonial, go to Testimonials → Add New in your WP Admin dashboard. Testimonials are composed of the testimonial text, the name of the customer — added as testimonial title — and an image or logo, which can be added as a Featured Image.

-- Testimonial Archive Page --

The testimonial archive page can be found at https://karunademo.wordpress.com/testimonial/ — just replace https://karunademo.wordpress.com/ with the URL of your website. All testimonials are displayed on the testimonial archive page, which can be added to a Custom Menu using the Links Panel.

This page can be further customized by adding a title, intro text, and featured image via Customizer → Testimonials. This content will appear above the testimonials list.


== Page Templates ==

Karuna comes with a Full-Width, No Sidebar Page Template to give you more space for your content. It’s the perfect way to showcase a large gallery of images or a video.


== Extras ==

Karuna comes with a special CSS style for buttons. You can add the button class to your links in the HTML Editor or a Text Widget to create “call to action” buttons.

Sample code:
<a href="https://karunademo.wordpress.com/" class="button">Button</a>


== Additional Support ==

* Custom Logo
* Custom Backgrounds


== Quick Specs (all measurements in pixels) ==

* The main column width is 624, except on the full-width template, where it's 1040.
